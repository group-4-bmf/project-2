### Who am I?

I am Squidward, Spongebob's unfortunate co-worker. A few things about me are that I hate life, hate Spongebob and dread my life as the cashier at the Krusty Jrab. 
The only thing that brings me joy is actually sleep and clarinets. Unfortunately, I live next to both of the dunces, Patrick and Spongebob who wake me up at random times
and perpetually annoy me.

### Job

I work as a cashier at the Krusty Krab where I serve Bikini BOttom's annoying residents who don't have a sense of taste. THere's a rumor going around that I've tasted and liked a 
Krabby Patty but that's not true! Every day customers come in and I scoff at their ability to like this garbage food.



### Fun Facts

1. I can play clarinet in my sleep and often do.

2. I have stepped in for Santa Claus in Bikini Bottom when he was busy.

3. My nose inflates and deflates as I laugh.

4. I'm the only character that often breaks the fourth wall regularly on the show.
