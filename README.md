### Who am I?

I am a sponge, who wears square pants every day of the week. My days usually start off with the most important meal
of the day, which also gives me time to feed my pet snail, Gary!! Once we both had our meals, I head to the best place
in the whole Bikini Bottom ( Not including Jellyfish feilds) The Krusty Krab!!!

### Job

The Krusty Krab is like a second home to me, I even lived there once when I had trouble showing up ealry to work.
My manager Mr.Krabs is the owner of the establishment, and hired me back when I had my huge silver screen debute. 
Ever since I saw that "Help Wanted" sign, I have loved flipping patties for Mr.Krabs. Over the years I have met many
people through the Krusty Krab, such as Whatsittoya, King Neptune, and even Mr.Krabs enemy Plankton.
